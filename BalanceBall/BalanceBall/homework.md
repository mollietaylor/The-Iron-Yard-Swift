Homework: brand new app (single view application, use main VC)

2 things: CoreMotion, UIKit Dynamics

create a single ball in the center of the screen. set gravity to nothing. based on (2 of) your yaw, pitch, and roll, as you rotate the screen, you should update the gravity to make the ball roll around on the screen

UIKit Dynamics for the ball; rotation from CoreMotion to change the gravity of the ball

look at a Labyrinth game to get a feel for how it should work
